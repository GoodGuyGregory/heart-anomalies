## Heart Anomalies

This paper Links to an external site. by Kurgan et al describes diagnosis of heart anomalies using machine learning on SPECT radiography data. The authors' dataset was made available for public use. There is an archive at https://github.com/pdx-cs-ai/heart-anomaly-hwLinks to an external site. containing background that you should read, but I would like you to use heart-anomalies.csv on our Github at https://github.com/pdx-cs-ai/miniproject-data-fall2023Links to an external site.. Each instance row in this dataset has binary class followed by features.

I used machine learning to improve upon their results. Construct a machine learner that can achieve at least 70% accuracy in classifying instances as anomalous vs normal.

Using a model with a decision tree classification algorithm. I was able to achieve a resulting predicition of over 70% accuracy to classify these instances as normal and abnormal. with a binary classification based on 45 individual features from the original dataset
